    filter: () => !isbot(navigator.userAgent),
    onsuccess: () => stats.count('axios.interceptor.perimeterx.success', 1),
    onfailure: () => stats.count('axios.interceptor.perimeterx.failure', 1),
    onerror: error => logger.error(error),
    customClass: 'my-challenge-popup',

### API
#### `filter` {function}
Filter function is fired **before** the intercepting function. If filter is passed as an argument, it **must return a truthy value** for the interceptor to fulfil it's role. **Falsy values will result in the interceptor passing the response as is**.
It's signature includes the following named arguments:

| Name | Type | Meaning | Usage
| - | - | - | -
| `path` | string | Request original path | `{ filter: ({ path }) => !/^\/(tracking\|beacon)(\/\|$)/.test(path) }`
| `appId` | string | PerimeterX Application ID | `{ filter: ({ appId }) => appId === window._pxAppId }`
